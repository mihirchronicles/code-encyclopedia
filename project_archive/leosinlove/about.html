                <p>Hey Babygirl! These are the words that came across when we met up during one of our first St.
                    Patrick’s Day. The joy of excitement and the choice of words embarrassed her. Maturity was subpar
                    yet she continued believing in us. According to Urban Dictionary, “Babygirl” means, “the most
                    wonderful person that a guy could ever meet. Someone who means more than anything in the entire
                    world.” Yep, I just used Urban Dictionary.</p>
                <p>To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around, it is indeed true. A kind hearted
                    woman who cherishes her family, friends and kids (no, we don’t have kids!). A miracle to spend time
                    with a person who is bigger than herself. A partnership that I am looking forward to (Rachna
                    rolling her eyes) in which we can laugh forever and grow together.</p>

                    <p>Mihir and I met in November 2013 when I awkwardly asked him if he was the “pen guy”. Blushingly,
                        he responded “YES!” Soon after, I received a Facebook chat from Mihir asking me to “grab
                        drinks” to which I agreed. After a four hour conversation that night, we parted ways. My sister
                        asked me what I thought of him and I told her he was too “mature” for me and I did not want to
                        pursue this any further. Who was I kidding?!</p>
                    <p>We went on a 2nd, and 3rd date. On our 4th date, he took me to see the beautiful lights of
                        Chicago and asked me to be his girlfriend (but also told me that if I refused, he would leave
                        me stranded in the city and make me take the train home..). I had no choice but to say YES! 3
                        years later I said YES again (after he told me he would leave me stranded on the mountain if I
                        refused…do you see a pattern here?!)</p>
                    <p>And I can’t wait to say YES yet again for the third time on our wedding day!</p>
